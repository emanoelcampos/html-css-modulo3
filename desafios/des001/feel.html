                I feel like a chip on my shoulders <br>
                I feel like I'm losin' my focus <br>
                I feel like I'm losin' my patience <br>
                I feel like my thoughts in the basement <br>
                Feel like, I feel like you're miseducated <br>
                Feel like I don't wanna be bothered <br>
                I feel like you may be the problem <br>
                I feel like it ain't no tomorrow, fuck the world <br>
                The world is endin', I'm done pretendin' <br>
                And fuck you if you get offended <br>
                I feel like friends been overrated <br>
                I feel like the family been fakin' <br>
                I feel like the feelings are changin' <br>
                Feel like my daughter compromised and jaded <br>
                Feel like you wanna scrutinize how I made it <br>
                Feel like I ain't feelin' you all <br>
                Feel like removin' myself, no feelings involved <br>
                I feel for you, I've been in the field for you <br>

                I feel niggas been out of pocket <br>
                I feel niggas tappin' they pockets <br>
                I feel like debated on who the greatest can stop it <br>
                I am legend, I feel like all of y'all is peasants <br>
                I feel like all of y'all is desperate <br>
                I feel like all it take is a second to feel like <br>
                Mike Jordan whenever holdin' a real mic
                I ain't feelin' your presence <br>
                Feel like I'ma learn you a lesson <br>
                Feel like only me and the music, though <br>
                I feel like your feelin' ain't mutual
                I feel like the enemy you should know <br>
                Feel like the feelin' of no hope <br>
                The feelin' of bad dope <br>
                A quarter ounce manipulated from soap <br>
                The feelin', the feelin' of false freedom <br>
                I'll force-feed 'em the poison that fill 'em up in the prison

                I feel like it's just me <br>
                Look, I feel like I can't breathe <br>
                Look, I feel like I can't sleep <br>
                Look, I feel heartless, often off this <br>
                Feelin' of fallin', of fallin' apart with <br>
                Darkest hours, lost it <br>
                Fillin' the void of bein' employed with ballin' <br>
                Streets is talkin', fill in the blanks with coffins <br>
                Fill up the banks with dollars <br>
                Fill up the graves with fathers <br>
                Fill up the babies with bullshit <br>
                Internet blogs and pulpit, fill 'em with gossip <br>
                I feel like this gotta be the feelin' what 'Pac was <br>
                The feelin' of an apocalypse happenin' <br>
                But nothin' is awkward, the feelin' won't prosper <br>
                The feelin' is toxic, I feel like I'm boxin' demons <br>
                Monsters, false prophets schemin' <br>
                Sponsors, industry promises <br>
                Niggas, bitches, honkies, crackers, Compton <br>
                Church, religion, token blacks, and bondage <br>

                Fuck your feelings, I mean this for imposters <br>
                I can feel it, the phoenix sure to watch us <br>
                I can feel it, the dream is more than process <br>
                I can put a regime that forms a Loch Ness <br>
                I can feel it, the scream that haunts our logic <br>
                I feel like say somethin', I feel like take somethin' <br>
                I feel like skatin' off, I feel like waitin' for 'em <br>
                Maybe it's too late for 'em <br>
                I feel like the whole world want me to pray for 'em <br>
                But who the fuck prayin' for me? <br>
                Ain't nobody prayin' for me <br>
                Who prayin' for me? <br>
                Ain't nobody prayin'
